Purpose: Using a database and adding to it with the c language. Customers can check out items in the database while admins can add
		 delete or display the database.
		 
TIPS & TRICKS:
First you must update mysql_connect.h with YOUR specific values. Database will not work without it.
After that it does not matter. You can use a current database, or create a brand new one and link it to mysql_connect.h 

Also must make a file called reciepts otherwise it will not print correctly after shopping cart.




Thoughts & Problems:
C is a hard langauge to manipulate the database with. It's simple to do queries, however  the program becomes
very long as you are just constantly throwing queries into a database and always checking if you can connect to it with conn 	
other than that, very useful once the main frame is open. As users and admins adding to a database would rather see a menu screen
than straight sql language.
